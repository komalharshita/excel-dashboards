## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Turn raw sales records into **actionable visual insights**.  
- Provide an **interactive, filterable dashboard** for quick business checks (city, month, category, rep, year).  
- Present both **trend** (monthwise) and **segmented** (city / channel / category / rep) views.

## 📂 Files in this folder
- `Sales & Profit Data.xlsx` — the working Excel workbook (dashboard + raw data).

## 🚀 How to use
1. Open `Sales & Profit Data.xlsx` in Excel.  
2. If prompted, **Enable Content** (so slicers and pivot cache load).  
3. Use the left-side slicers (Year / Month / Category) to filter the whole dashboard.  
4. Click any chart element (e.g., a bar or map region) to cross-filter other visuals.  
5. To refresh after replacing data: **Right-click → Refresh** on any PivotTable or use **Data → Refresh All**.

---

## ✨ Key insights 
- Which **city** or **state** brings the highest revenue?  
- Do **online** or **retail** channels perform better this year?  
- Which **category** is growing month-over-month?  
- Who are the **top-performing reps/customers** worth rewarding?

---


## 🔮 Future improvements (roadmap)
- Add KPI tiles (Avg Order Value, Conversion %, YoY growth).  
- Add conditional formatting for quick red/green signals.  
- Automate data ingestion via **Power Query** (CSV, Google Sheets, or database).  
- Recreate in **Power BI** for advanced interactivity and sharing.  
- Add a small `INSIGHTS.md` capturing monthly observations.
